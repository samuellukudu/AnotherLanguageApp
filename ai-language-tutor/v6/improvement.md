Adopt a Layered/Hexagonal Architecture:
• Create separate layers (e.g. API/Controller, service/business logic, repository, and infrastructure).
• This decouples FastAPI endpoints (backend/main.py) from the business logic and database concerns.

Service and Utility Separation:
• Move business logic out of API endpoints into dedicated service classes or modules. For instance, the logic for processing completions in generate_completions.py could be placed in a service module.
• This makes relocating or unit testing business logic easier.

Configuration Management:
• Use a centralized configuration module (possibly using pydantic’s BaseSettings) so that environment variables and settings are validated and organized. This will benefit both local development and production.

Routing and Module Organization:
• Create separate routers for different functionalities (curriculum, flashcards, exercises, simulation) to keep main.py lean and maintainable.
• Group related endpoints into modules and use dependency injection for shared resources (like database connections).

Testing and Error Handling:
• Enhance logging, error handling, and add more structured exceptions across layers.
• Incorporate more unit and integration tests for individual components (such as services and repositories).

Container and Deployment Considerations:
• Update your Dockerfile and docker-compose setup to support a multi-stage build for production, logging, and health checks.
• This modular structure will make it easier to scale services independently.

Additional Context for Codebase Improvement:
• Emphasize comprehensive documentation and inline comments to clarify architectural decisions.
• Establish and enforce coding standards consistent with the layered architecture for better maintainability.
• Integrate automated testing frameworks (e.g., pytest) to continually validate both business logic and API endpoints.
• Adopt security best practices (e.g., input validation, rate limiting) and resilience patterns (e.g., circuit breakers) to safeguard production deployments.
• Document deployment procedures and update README files to onboard new developers effectively.

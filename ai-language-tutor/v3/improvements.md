Okay, looking at your current API structure (FastAPI, user-centric generation, database connection), here are several potential API endpoints you could add to enhance your language learning application, keeping the goal of personalized, fast learning in mind:

**I. User Profile & Preferences:**

1.  **`GET /users/{user_id}/profile`**
    *   **Purpose:** Retrieve user-specific information like name, email (if stored), registration date, and most importantly, their default learning preferences.
    *   **Data Needed:** `user_id` (path parameter).
    *   **Response:** JSON object with profile details (e.g., `{"user_id": 123, "username": "LinguaLearner", "default_target_language": "Spanish", "default_base_language": "English", "self_assessed_level": "Intermediate"}`).
    *   **Interaction:** Reads from the user profile table in your database.

2.  **`PUT /users/{user_id}/profile`**
    *   **Purpose:** Allow users to update their profile information, especially their default languages and potentially their self-assessed proficiency level. This helps personalize future requests even without explicit parameters in the query.
    *   **Data Needed:** `user_id` (path parameter), request body with fields to update (e.g., `{"default_target_language": "French", "self_assessed_level": "Beginner"}`).
    *   **Interaction:** Updates the user profile table in your database.

**II. Learning Progress & History:**

3.  **`POST /progress/log`**
    *   **Purpose:** Allow the frontend to log when a user has interacted with or "completed" a learning unit (e.g., reviewed a flashcard set, finished an exercise batch, read a story). This is crucial for tracking progress and potentially feeding into a review system.
    *   **Data Needed:** Request body containing `user_id`, `content_type` ('flashcards', 'exercises', 'simulation'), maybe `content_id` (if you save generated content) or `topic_query` (the original query), and perhaps `performance_metric` (e.g., score on exercises, time spent). `{"user_id": 123, "content_type": "exercises", "topic_query": "Marketing terms in French", "score": 0.8}`.
    *   **Interaction:** Writes a record to a progress/history table in your database.

4.  **`GET /progress/{user_id}/summary`**
    *   **Purpose:** Provide the user with an overview of their learning activity (e.g., number of sessions, topics covered, estimated words learned).
    *   **Data Needed:** `user_id` (path parameter).
    *   **Response:** JSON object summarizing progress metrics (e.g., `{"sessions_count": 50, "topics_learned": ["Marketing", "Photography", "Cooking"], "flashcards_reviewed": 250}`).
    *   **Interaction:** Aggregates data from the progress/history table.

5.  **`GET /history/{user_id}`**
    *   **Purpose:** Retrieve a list of the user's recent learning sessions or generated content topics.
    *   **Data Needed:** `user_id` (path parameter), potentially query parameters for pagination (`?page=1&limit=10`).
    *   **Response:** JSON array of past session/topic entries. `[{"timestamp": "...", "topic_query": "...", "content_type": "..."}, ...]`.
    *   **Interaction:** Reads from the progress/history table, likely ordered by timestamp.

**III. Content Management & Review:**

6.  **`POST /content/save`** (Optional, depends on if you want users to save specific generations)
    *   **Purpose:** Allow users to explicitly save a generated set of flashcards, exercises, or a story they found particularly useful or want to revisit.
    *   **Data Needed:** Request body with `user_id`, `content_type`, `content_data` (the actual JSON generated), and `original_query`.
    *   **Interaction:** Saves the content JSON (or references it) to a user-specific saved content table.

7.  **`GET /content/saved/{user_id}`** (Counterpart to POST /content/save)
    *   **Purpose:** Retrieve the list of content items the user has explicitly saved.
    *   **Data Needed:** `user_id` (path parameter).
    *   **Response:** JSON array of saved content items.
    *   **Interaction:** Reads from the saved content table.

8.  **`GET /review/{user_id}`** (More Advanced - Requires Spaced Repetition Logic)
    *   **Purpose:** Retrieve learning items (e.g., specific flashcards or difficult exercise concepts) that are due for review based on a spaced repetition system (SRS). This is key for long-term retention.
    *   **Data Needed:** `user_id` (path parameter).
    *   **Response:** JSON array of items due for review (could be flashcards, words, or concepts needing reinforcement).
    *   **Interaction:** Requires a more complex database schema to track individual item review status and apply SRS logic (e.g., Leitner system, SM2 algorithm).

**IV. Feedback:**

9.  **`POST /feedback`**
    *   **Purpose:** Allow users to provide feedback on the quality or relevance of the generated content. This is invaluable for improving your prompts or potentially fine-tuning models later.
    *   **Data Needed:** Request body with `user_id` (optional but helpful), `content_type`, `original_query`, `generated_content` (or an ID), and `feedback_text` or `rating`.
    *   **Interaction:** Logs feedback into a dedicated feedback table.

**Considerations:**

*   **Authentication/Authorization:** You have `user_id` in requests, implying users are logged in. Ensure you have a proper authentication mechanism (e.g., JWT tokens) protecting these endpoints, especially those modifying data (POST, PUT).
*   **Database Schema:** Adding progress tracking, saved content, and especially review features will require careful design of your PostgreSQL database schema.
*   **Error Handling:** Continue using `HTTPException` for clear error responses.
*   **Async:** Keep using `async def` for your endpoints, especially those involving database I/O or external API calls (like `generate_completions`).

Start with the endpoints that provide the most immediate value for personalization and tracking (User Profile, Progress Logging/History). Then consider adding content saving and feedback. A full SRS review system is powerful but significantly more complex to implement correctly.

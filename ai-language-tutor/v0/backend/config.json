Your task is to create a one-month intensive language learning curriculum tailored to user's specific learning objectives and preferences. The curriculum should be divided into four weeks, with each week building upon the previous one.\n\n**Curriculum Design Principles:**\n\n1.  **Intensive:** The curriculum should be designed for significant weekly study time.\n2.  **Structured:** The curriculum should be divided into four weeks, with each week building upon the previous one.\n3.  **Comprehensive:** Include a variety of learning activities, such as vocabulary building, grammar study, reading, writing, listening, and speaking practice.\n4.  **Personalized:** Adapt the curriculum to the user's learning goals, current level, and interests.\n5.  **Measurable:** Suggest ways the user can track their progress.\n6.  **Output Format:** Provide the curriculum in a valid JSON format.\n7.  **Weekly Content:** Instead of daily content, focus on providing a theme and a set of activities for each week. Include the approximate time the user should invest in that week.\n\n**Output JSON Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"language\": \"target_language\",\n  \"learning_goal\": \"user_provided_goal\",\n  \"current_level\": \"user_provided_level\",\n  \"weeks\": [\n    {\n      \"week\": 1,\n      \"theme\": \"week_theme\",\n      \"estimated_duration\": \"estimated_weekly_time\",\n      \"activities\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"activity_type\",\n          \"description\": \"activity_description\",\n          \"resources\": [\"resource1\", \"resource2\", ...]\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"activity_type\",\n          \"description\": \"activity_description\",\n          \"resources\": [\"resource1\", \"resource2\", ...]\n        },\n        ...\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"week\": 2,\n      \"theme\": \"week_theme\",\n      \"estimated_duration\": \"estimated_weekly_time\",\n      \"activities\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"activity_type\",\n          \"description\": \"activity_description\",\n          \"resources\": [\"resource1\", \"resource2\", ...]\n        },\n        ...\n      ]\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n",
